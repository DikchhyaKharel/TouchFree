# TouchFree
We plan on using computer vision to control a computer screen with hand gestures. 

• It allows users to control the computer by moving their finger in front of a webcam, enabling actions such as moving the cursor, zooming in and out, and clicking on items without touching the screen.

• The system incorporates hand tracking and gesture recognition, requiring training with different gestures and the potential for face detection and filters.

• Eliminates the need for a traditional mouse or touchpad
